# codingquiz-for-whomever-is_the_wiz

## Description

In this assignment we had to write up code from scratch. We were to give a small quiz with questions about the basics of coding

### Things Learned

In this assignment seemed to be focused on event listeners. We used them to listen for "click" of the start button so that the countdown function, and the questions function would fire. We used queryselector or get elementbyID to link parts of our code to the html elements. We also used a questions variable and were able to get into the array by calling on the children of the array.


I worked with this code for a long time, probably too long. I built alot of the code with another student, but then worked for hours trying to reverse engineer what worked and what didn't. I understad the basics of linking an attribute to the javascript and css. In doing so was able to hide code and bring it back when needed.
